# wam-prototype
This is a project to develop wam decode-encode. I coded the majority of this in a singular 21 hour streak without food or sleep. Enjoy ðŸ˜†. 
It was super spaghetti before moving it to Typescript


## WE ARE DONE!
Finally, we have matched input (test_extract) -> decoded it (file.json, detailed more is data.json) -> encoded it again (test_encode), WITH BIT PERFECT ACCURACY!
